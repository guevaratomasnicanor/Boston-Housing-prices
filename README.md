#variables: crim(crime rate), zn( residential houses rate), indus( industry rate), chas(if district borders Charles river), nox(nitrate oxide concentration), rm(median rooms per house), age, dis(mean distance to employment centers), rad(highway accesibility), tax, ptratio( student to professor ratio), black( black population), lstat( low status populatio ratio), medv( median house value)

#Insights
-Industrial zones, higher crame rates, higher pollution, higher percentage of low status individuals or higher student to professor ratio means lower house value.
- Residential zones or more rooms make higher house prices
- Houses that border Charles river are more expensive.
- XGBOOST is the best model with an RMSE of 2.93 and 2.07 MAE.
